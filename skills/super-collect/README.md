# /super-collect

Finds problems in one project and files them as deduped Backlog cards on its super-board. The
board fixes them.

## What It Does

- Reads pluggable sources: **sentry** (unresolved errors), **posthog** (exceptions, failure
  events, rage and dead clicks, slow pages, survey themes, tracking gaps), **loki** (error log
  groups for one required selector), **prometheus** (firing alerts, down scrape targets), **github** (open issues
  not on the board, adopted rather than copied), **prs** (recurring problems across merged PRs and
  their human, bot and super-review comments) and **architecture** (read-only refactor finder).
- Checks every candidate with one fresh verifier: is it real, still happening, already fixed, or a
  duplicate. Unclear ones are filed with `needs-triage`, never silently dropped.
- Reports a source it cannot reach as `unavailable`, never `empty`: the Sentry and PostHog
  fetchers print `{"status":"unavailable","error":…}` and exit 2.
- Reaches a Loki / Prometheus that lives inside a remote Docker network over
  `transport: {"kind":"ssh","host":…,"docker_network":…}` (GET only, URL-encoded, quoted).
- Files one card per real problem across sources: Sentry, Loki and PostHog exceptions carry a
  `crossSignature` (type, normalized message, top in-app frame); a second source with the same
  signature adds an evidence comment to the open card instead of filing another.
- Adds a Trace line to Evidence when a candidate has a trace id, summarised from **Tempo**
  (optional enricher, `collect.tempo`, not a source) with a Grafana Explore link.
- Labels a filed body that is too thin to build `needs-triage` (`super-board-card-ready.py`).
- Files through `super-qa-file-bug.sh` and `super-review-file-refactor.sh`, always into the
  holding column. Nothing reaches `Ready` until `super-board lint` says so.

## Usage

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/super-collect` | every source enabled in the config |
| `/super-collect sentry` | one source (or several) |
| `--since 30d` / `--since 2026-09-01` | window, default 14 days |
| `--yes` | file without the confirm step |

Dry-run is the default: you see what would be filed, then confirm.

## Setup

`/super-board onboard` sets up the `collect` block per project: it detects Sentry and PostHog,
asks which sources to enable, writes IDs and hosts to the config, and tests each connection
read-only. Secrets stay in a gitignored env file (`.env.local` whenever `.env` is tracked by git;
`collect_common.py secret-file` prints which): `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (scopes `event:read project:read`),
`POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` (`query:read`, `error_tracking:read`). Loki and Prometheus need no
secret: `collect.loki` (`url`, required `selector`) and `collect.prometheus` (`url`); the
optional Tempo enricher reads `collect.tempo` (`url`, `grafana_url`, `grafana_datasource_uid`).
`collect_loki.py check` also backs the post-deploy telemetry check (`deploy.telemetry`).

## Install

Ships in the super-board pack under `skills/super-collect/`; `install.sh` copies it to
`.claude/skills/super-collect/`. Needs a super-board config, `gh`, `jq` and Python 3 (stdlib only).

Tests: `bash tests/test-collect-file.sh` · `bash tests/test-collect-fetchers.sh` ·
`bash tests/test-collect-baseline.sh` · `python3 tests/test_collect_baseline.py` (offline, all in
`tests/run-safety.sh`). The baseline suites replay the canned Sentry, PostHog and PR payloads in
`tests/fixtures/collect/`: fingerprint dedupe, ticket-format checks, the dry run, unreachable
sources.

Evals: the four `collect-*` cases in [`evals/`](../../evals/README.md) run the skill on a model
(paid, not in CI): Sentry verdicts, duplicate, PostHog gap, PR pattern.
