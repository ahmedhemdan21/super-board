# Seeds a PostHog collect run (dry-run). No signal clears its threshold (vitals are under the
# limits, exceptions and rage clicks are a handful of people), so the only ticket is a tracking
# gap: of the app's user workflows, signup and checkout capture started / completed / failed
# events that arrive in PostHog, and receipt upload (/receipts/upload, src/receipts/upload.ts:
# no capture calls, no events). Expected: exactly one `feature` ticket, label analytics,
# fingerprint gap|<receipt-upload workflow>, and no app code edited.
